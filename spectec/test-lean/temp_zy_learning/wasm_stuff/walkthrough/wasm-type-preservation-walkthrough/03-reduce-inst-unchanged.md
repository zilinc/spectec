# 3. `reduce_inst_unchanged`

*(Previous: [02-store-extension-reduce.md](02-store-extension-reduce.md). Next: [04-extend-store-moduleinst.md](04-extend-store-moduleinst.md).)*

**Plain-English summary.** *A single step never changes which module a frame belongs to.* The frame's `LOCALS` can change (that's what `local.set` does); its `MODULE` field — the addresses this code's indices resolve through — never does. This matters because a function call pushes a brand-new `FRAME_` with the *callee's* module instance, but that's a nested/different frame, not a mutation of the current one.

**Code** — [TypePreservation.lean:502-540](../../spectec/src/test-lean-claude/TypePreservation.lean#L502-L540):

**Signature.** Simplicity itself: from one `Step` between two `(store, frame, instrs)` triples, conclude the *old* frame's `MODULE` equals the *new* frame's `MODULE` — no other hypotheses needed at all (this fact doesn't depend on typing, only on which operational rule fired).

**Proof sketch.** Induct over all 23 `Step` constructors (primer §0.8's `_aux` pattern again). `ctxt_frame` is interesting *by its absence from the explicit cases*: it changes only the frame *wrapped inside* a `FRAME_` marker, not the ambient `(s,f,...)` triple the lemma is stated about, so it falls into the `all_goals` catch-all along with every store-writing rule (none of which touch `frame.MODULE`, only `store` fields — confirmed by `simp_all` unfolding every `with_*` updater and finding nothing to do). `ctxt_label`/`ctxt_instrs` recurse via `ih` since they wrap a *further* step at the same frame. `local_set` is the one genuinely interesting case: `with_local` only overwrites the indexed slot of `LOCALS`, so `MODULE` survives by `rfl` once that's unfolded.
