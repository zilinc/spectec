# 1. `t_preservation` — the top-level theorem

*(Previous: [00-primer.md](00-primer.md). Next: [02-store-extension-reduce.md](02-store-extension-reduce.md).)*

**Plain-English summary.** This is it — WASM 2.0's type soundness statement, preservation half. *If* a machine configuration is well-typed at some result type `ts`, *and* it takes one step, *then* the new configuration is still well-typed at that same `ts`. Nothing about execution ever invalidates the type system's guarantees. The Rocq source literally comments this lemma `(* Ultimate goal of project *)`.

**Signature.** `c1 c2 : config` are the full before/after machine states; `ts : resulttype` is the fixed type the whole configuration is checked at (think: "the overall program's declared result type"). `Step c1 c2` is one execution step; `Config_ok c1 ts` is the hypothesis; `Config_ok c2 ts` — *same* `ts` — is the conclusion. Note what's *not* parametrized: there's no weakening of `ts` between the two sides. One step can't change what type the whole computation is ultimately aiming for.

**Proof sketch.** Destructure `c1`/`c2` into `(store, frame, instrs)` triples, then peel `Config_ok` → `State_ok` → `Frame_ok` (which itself contains `Moduleinst_ok` and the locals' typing) and `Expr_ok2` via three nested `cases`. That hands you five separate facts about the *pre*-state. Get well-formedness of the *post*-state for free from the generated (and separately, fully proved) `Step_is_wf`. Then compute four facts about the transition, each delegated to one child lemma: the store extends and stays `Store_ok` (`store_extension_reduce`), the frame's module instance is literally unchanged (`reduce_inst_unchanged`), that unchanged module instance is still `Moduleinst_ok` in the bigger store (`Extend_store_moduleinst`), the locals are still well-typed (`t_preservation_vs_type`), and the instruction sequence is still well-typed (`t_preservation_type`). Finally, `exact Config_ok.mk_Config_ok ...` re-assembles exactly the same nested structure for `c2` out of those five facts — the "re-packs the same structure for `c2`" the diagram promised.
