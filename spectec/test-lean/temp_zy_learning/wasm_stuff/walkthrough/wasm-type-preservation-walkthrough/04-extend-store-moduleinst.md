# 4. `Extend_store_moduleinst`

*(Previous: [03-reduce-inst-unchanged.md](03-reduce-inst-unchanged.md). Next: [05-t-preservation-vs-type.md](05-t-preservation-vs-type.md).)*

**Plain-English summary.** If the store only grew, every fact "address `a` in module instance `i` has type `t`" that held in the old store still holds in the new one — growing the store can't invalidate an existing module's view of it, because every component only ever grows or (for globals/data/elem) changes in a way that's compatible with its old type.

**Signature.** `Extend_store v_S v_S'` (the growth fact) plus `Moduleinst_ok v_S v_i v_C` (the old typing) implies `Moduleinst_ok v_S' v_i v_C` — *same* `v_i`, *same* `v_C`; only the store argument changes. This is the lemma `type_preservation.v`'s own doc comment calls "the key assembly lemma, reused by `step_moduleinst`" (confirmed in the Lean port's own comment too).

**Proof sketch.** Destructure `Extend_store` once to get its twenty component facts (one in-bounds-forward, one in-bounds-backward, one per-address `Extend_*inst` fact, times six store sorts). Destructure `Moduleinst_ok`'s one constructor to get the module instance's own fourteen component facts. Rebuild the *same* constructor for `v_S'`, replacing each "address `a` resolves to something of type `t`" fact with a version re-derived through the matching `Extend_*`: `addrss_store_globals_extension`/`_funcs_extension`/`_mems_extension`/`_tables_extension` each do "old resolves at type `t`, and the store only extended at that sort, so new resolves at the *same* `t`" for globals/funcs/mems/tables (where the type absolutely cannot change); elements and data get the slightly different `Extend_store_exts`/`Extend_store_datainst_ext`/`Extend_store_eleminst_ext` treatment (since those two sorts can also "change" by being dropped to `[]`, which `Eleminst_ok`/`Datainst_ok` happen to tolerate because the all-`[]`/all-dropped instance is still well-typed at its original declared type — an empty list of refs still has every ref at the claimed reftype, vacuously).
